            <p>We are a group of motivated students who wish to create an environment for anyone who wishes to begin
                with tech projects. We believe that there is no task impossible and no target unachievable. Our major
                goal is creating an ecosystem where developers come to seek help for their projects and our platform
                will connect likeâ€”minded</p>
